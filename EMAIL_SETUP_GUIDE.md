## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to authenticate on SMTP server"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password.

### Issue 2: "Connection could not be established with host smtp.gmail.com"
**Solution:** 
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure port 587 is not blocked by firewall
- Try port 465 with `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl` instead

### Issue 3: Emails not arriving
**Solution:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address in order is correct
- Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Issue 4: "Address in mailbox given does not conform to RFC"
**Solution:** Remove quotes from `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` in .env:
```env
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@fixit.com
```
